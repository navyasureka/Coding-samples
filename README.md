The current project was a part of my Applied Econometrics project. The main aim was to use ECLSK-11 dataset for American students and show how the gaps in scores between the Blacks and Whites evolves over the first six years of schooling. The analysis is an extension of the Fryer Levitt papers (2004,2006).

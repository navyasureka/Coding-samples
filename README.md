# Coding-samples:
A short description of each of the files:
1) Poverty code: Using SILC data to calculate poverty rates based on different methods
2) Inequality Code: The assignment involved using data from the Cote D'ivoirian household survey to make lorenz curves and Growth incidence curves to analyse issues of inequality.
3) Education Code:The current project was a part of my Applied Econometrics project. The main aim was to use ECLSK-11 dataset for American students and show how the gaps in scores between the Blacks and Whites evolves over the first six years of schooling. The analysis is an extension of the Fryer Levitt papers (2004,2006).
4) Labour code: This assignment involved calculating the different employment and unemployment rates using data from the French Labours Force Survey.
5) Other visualisations: Shows another assignment using ggplot variations for data visualisations
